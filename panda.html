                <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Adult individuals average 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb), and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long. The species is sexually dimorphic, as males are typically 10 to 20% larger. The fur is white, with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. A thumb is visible on the bear's forepaw, which helps in holding bamboo in place for feeding. Giant pandas have adapted larger molars and expanded temporal fossa to meet their dietary requirements.Giant pandas are only found in six mountains in a few provinces. They are also found in elevations of up to 3,000 m (9,800 ft). Its diet consists almost entirely of bamboo, making the bear mostly herbivorous, despite being classified in the order Carnivora. The shoot is important to bears, as it contains starch and is 32% protein, hence pandas evolved the ability to effectively digest starch.Adults measure around 1.2 to 1.9 metres (3 feet 11 inches to 6 feet 3 inches) long, including a tail of about 10–15 cm (4–6 in), and 60 to 90 cm (24 to 35 in) tall at the shoulder. Males can weigh up to 160 kg (350 lb). Females (generally 10–20% smaller than males) can weigh as little as 70 kg (150 lb), but can also weigh up to 125 kg (276 lb).The average weight for adults is 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb).</p>
                <p>The giant panda is endemic to China. They are found in small, fragmented populations in only six mountainous regions in the country, mainly in Sichuan, and also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.The giant panda is endemic to China. They are found in small, fragmented populations in only six mountainous regions in the country, mainly in Sichuan, and also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.The giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, limbs and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white.The bear's distinctive coloration appears to serve as camouflage in both winter and summer environments as they do not hibernate. The white areas may serve as camouflage in snow, while the black shoulders and legs conceal them in shade.</p>
                <p>Pandas eat any of 25 bamboo species in the wild, such as Fargesia dracocephala and Fargesia rufa.Only a few bamboo species are widespread at the high altitudes pandas now inhabit. Bamboo leaves contain the highest protein levels; stems have less.</p>
